# SQL Movie Database Analysis

A mini SQL project analyzing a movie database using MySQL. It includes five queries to explore relationships between movies, actors, genres, and ratings.

## Queries

1. 🎬 Movies with no genre.
2. 🎭 Movies where the lead actor is also the director.
3. 🏆 Top actors with most lead roles.
4. ⭐ Genre-wise rating stats (avg, max, min).
5. 👥 Top 10 actor pairs who co-starred most often.

## Files

- `code.sql`: All queries (divided into 5 sections).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Notes

- Works on MySQL.
- Test syntax using [dbfiddle.uk](https://dbfiddle.uk).
